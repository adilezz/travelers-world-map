# Travelers World Map — Database Architecture and Pipeline

Document 6 of the v2 set. Version 2.0, 1 October 2026. Reads with document 1 (the place model) and document 7 (validation).

This document is the contract for how the place database is stored, identified, built, versioned and published. Code under `database/` implements it. Where code and this document disagree, this document wins and the code is wrong.

---

## 1. Constraints and strategy

The project is personal. Money and licensing do not bound the design; effort and correctness do. The cost strategy is therefore:

- **Bulk dumps, processed once, on one machine.** No per-request fees, no API in the build path.
- **Pin every input.** A build is reproducible from named snapshots.
- **Filter early.** Stream the large dumps once into small columnar files; everything after runs on a laptop in minutes.
- **One store.** One DuckDB file is the truth; every published file is generated from it.
- **Free first, paid on proof.** A paid source (an imagery licence, a routing API, a curated dataset) is added only when a gate shows free data cannot pass it.

### 1.1 Licensing posture

Personal use removes licensing as a *design* constraint, not as a *record*. Every asset still carries `source`, `source_url`, `licence` and `retrieved`, so that a future decision to share, publish or sell the atlas is a filter on the data and not a rebuild. Share-alike (OSM ODbL) and non-commercial (WDPA) sources are marked `restricted: true` in the source table. A `--shareable` build flag excludes them. The owner commits that Google Places data is **never** stored or cached; only an optional place identifier may be kept, and only to link out.

## 2. Stages

```
 0 snapshot      pin and hash raw inputs
 1 ingest        stream dumps into filtered Parquet
 2 candidates    class table → candidate entities
 3 assets        every source record → asset
 4 resolve       identity: match, merge, link (QID first)
 5 admit         rules R1–R6 → places; review queue
 6 enrich        names, aliases, geometry, admin units, links
 7 notability    N, tiers
 8 kinds         rules → place_kind; validate
 9 territories   countries, regions, printed pieces
10 print select  document 8
11 gates         document 7: any failure stops here
12 publish       bundle, manifest, report, registry commit
```

Each stage is an idempotent script that reads tables and writes tables. Nothing mutates a source file. Stages 0–1 are slow and run rarely; stages 2–12 run in minutes.

### 2.1 Snapshot (stage 0)

`inputs/MANIFEST.json` records, for each source: name, version or dump date, URL, byte size, SHA-256, licence, `restricted`. A build refuses to start if a pinned file's hash differs. Raw files live outside git (`data/raw/`); the manifest is committed.

### 2.2 Sources

| Source | Feeds | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Wikidata full dump | Candidates, QIDs, classes, sitelinks, coordinates, capitals, population, redirects | Backbone of identity |
| Wikipedia pageview dumps (12 months) | `PV` in notability | Current attention, damped |
| Wikipedia language links | `SL` | Cross-language significance |
| Wikivoyage dump | Corroboration (R4), kinds, "why go" text | Destinations and sections |
| UNESCO World Heritage List (+ criteria) | R1, `R`, kinds | Authoritative inscriptions, per-state parts |
| UNESCO intangible heritage lists, biosphere reserves, global geoparks | R1, `R`, kinds | Living culture |
| WDPA (with polygons) | R1, kinds | IUCN I–VI, full geometry, categories V and VI included |
| Ramsar Sites Information Service | R1, kinds | Wetlands |
| GeoNames (cities, `alternateNamesV2`) | Settlements, names, aliases, `name_local` | |
| OSM via regional extracts | Names, footprints, tourism density, OSM id | Planet only where a gate demands |
| Natural Earth, geoBoundaries | Land, admin-1, coastline, relief | Territories and print base |
| GHSL | Population and urban extent (context only) | Not a candidate source |
| Overture Places | Second opinion on duplicates | Never a seed |

Sources considered and **not** used as automated inputs: commercial guidebook and review sites (terms of use, and scraping is not repeatable). The owner may add what they know through `anchors.csv`.

### 2.3 Wikidata handling

- Stream the dump once; keep items that have a coordinate, or a WHS/WDPA/Ramsar identifier, and an instance-of chain reaching a class in `rules/classes.csv`. Store the filtered items as Parquet. The raw dump is never queried again.
- **Redirects and merges.** Wikidata merges items. Each snapshot's redirect table is stored; the registry (3.2) resolves any QID to its current target before matching, so a merged item never mints a second place.
- **Labels.** Keep English label, label in the country's official language(s), and aliases. A raw QID is never a name (7, gate G-NAMES).

## 3. Identity

### 3.1 `place_id`

`pl_` followed by 10 characters of Crockford base32, random, minted **once** when a place is first admitted:

```
pl_7k3m9q2x4f
```

An id encodes nothing: no country, source, version or build. It is never derived from a QID, GeoNames id or any upstream id, because those change. Prefixes can never collide because there are none.

### 3.2 The registry

`registry/place_registry.parquet` is committed to git and is the **only** source of identity. Append-only.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `place_id` | Permanent |
| `keys[]` | External keys that have identified it: `qid:Q…`, `wdpa:…`, `whs:…`, `geonames:…`, `osm:n/w/r…` |
| `status` | `active`, `retired`, `merged_into:<place_id>`, `split_from:<place_id>` |
| `minted_build`, `last_seen_build` | Audit |
| `tombstone_reason` | For retired |

Rules:

1. Each build resolves every admitted candidate to a registry row through its keys (QID first, then `wdpa`, `whs`, `geonames`, `osm`). A hit reuses the `place_id`; a miss mints one.
2. **A place that falls below a threshold keeps its id** with `status: retired`; if it re-qualifies later it is reactivated, not re-minted. A threshold change never changes an id.
3. A merge sets the loser to `merged_into:<survivor>`. Any visit record pointing at the loser resolves to the survivor.
4. A split mints a new id for the new part and records `split_from`; the original keeps its id.
5. An id is **never reused** for a different place. A build that does so fails gate G-ID.
6. Owner state (visits, wishlist, notes, overrides) is keyed to `place_id` only and follows `merged_into` chains.

### 3.3 Crosswalk with v1

`registry/v1_crosswalk.csv` maps every v1 id (`MOR-c2555567`, …) to the v2 `place_id` that supersedes it, or to `none` with a reason. v1 ids that pointed to a town standing in for a landmark map to the landmark (Quillabamba → Machu Picchu, where it was the credited asset) *and* to the settlement if it is itself admitted. Any v1 visit record migrates through this file once.

## 4. Schema (DuckDB: `atlas.duckdb`)

```sql
source(source_id, name, version, url, sha256, licence, restricted, retrieved)

asset(asset_id, source_id, source_key, role, class, name, geom, point,
      attrs JSON, licence, source_url, retrieved)        -- every source record

place(place_id, type, name_en, name_local, country_iso3, admin1_id,
      lat, lon, footprint, tier, tier_reason, why, evidence_depth,
      qid, osm_id, geonames_id, wdpa_id, whs_id, wikipedia,
      near_place_id, disputed, status, minted_build)

place_asset(place_id, asset_id, link_method, confidence, role)
              -- link_method: qid | external_tag | containment | name_distance | owner
place_alias(place_id, alias, lang, kind)            -- kind: endonym|exonym|translit|former
place_kind(place_id, kind, rule_id, strength, evidence_asset_ids[])
place_metric(place_id, sitelinks, pageviews_12m, recognition, size_term, n_raw)
place_parent(place_id, parent_id, relation)          -- part_of | gateway_of

merge_log(build, loser_key, survivor_place_id, method, reason)
split_log(build, place_id, new_place_id, reason)
review_queue(build, candidate_key, signals, reason)

territory(territory_id, iso3, sovereign_iso3, kind, display_policy, ruling_ref, geom)
region(region_id, territory_id, name, geom)                   -- web regions, full tessellation
piece(piece_id, edition, territory_id, name, geom, printable, place_ids[])
print_selection(edition, place_id, hole_lat, hole_lon, reason, pinned_by)
print_override(place_id, action, note)               -- force_in | force_out | swap

build(build_id, started, manifest_sha, git_commit, params JSON, gates JSON)
```

Rules for the schema:

- `asset` carries **one row per source record**, with its own provenance. The v1 omission of an assets table is the reason no place could say why it existed.
- `place_asset.link_method` and `confidence` make every attachment auditable. `name_distance` matches below 0.8 confidence go to review, not to the bundle.
- `place_kind.evidence_asset_ids` is mandatory; a kind with no evidence cannot be written.
- `tier` is derived, never edited in place. Owner changes go through `anchors.csv`, `merge_overrides.csv` and `print_override.csv`.

## 5. Determinism

Same inputs and same parameters give byte-identical outputs.

- Inputs are pinned (2.1). Parameters live in `params.json`, hashed into the build record.
- Every sort has a total order; ties break on `place_id`, then `asset_id`. No unseeded randomness; any stochastic step takes the seed from `params.json`.
- Anything produced by a model (draft labels, text suggestions) is **data, frozen in a committed file** after review; it is never recomputed in a build.
- The build manifest records the SHA-256 of every output file.

## 6. Bundle, versions and updates

The pipeline publishes an immutable bundle:

```
bundle/<build_id>/
  manifest.json          build id, inputs, params, counts, gate results, hashes
  places/<ISO3>.json     per-country register (while the atlas is under ~25k places)
  places.geojson         point layer for the map (properties trimmed)
  regions.geojson        web regions
  territories.geojson    printed pieces for the current edition
  search.json            names, aliases, ids for client search
  report/                gate and report outputs
```

- Per-country JSON while the database is small; vector tiles when it approaches 25,000 places.
- **Incremental refresh.** A refresh is a new build from newer snapshots. `diff.json` lists added, retired, merged, renamed, re-tiered places. A **churn tripwire** stops publication if more than 2 % of places change tier or id without a recorded cause (a deliberate parameter change).
- **Rollback** is repointing the manifest.
- Refresh cadence is manual and rare (a few times a year, or when the owner decides).

## 7. Names

A place shows the name a traveler would search for.

1. `name_en` is the common English name: the Wikidata English label, then the English Wikipedia title, then GeoNames' main name. Registry titles and official long forms are aliases, not names.
2. `name_local` is preserved in the local script, never stripped.
3. Aliases include the endonym, exonyms, former names and transliterations; search matches them, accent-insensitively.
4. A name that is a raw identifier, contains markup or a control character, exceeds 60 characters, or is a protected-area designation in a local language, fails gate G-NAMES and goes to a naming review file for the owner.

## 8. Geometry

- Every place has an anchor point; `area` places may have footprints from WDPA or OSM.
- Territory and region polygons come from Natural Earth and geoBoundaries, with disputed treatment from document 8 §7.
- Web regions tessellate each country's land (every place sits in exactly one); printed pieces are a separate set. They share `place_id` and never polygons.

## 9. Repository layout

```
database/
  inputs/MANIFEST.json
  rules/classes.csv  kinds.csv  tiers.json
  anchors/anchors.csv  merge_overrides.csv  print_override.csv
  registry/place_registry.parquet  v1_crosswalk.csv
  golden/golden.csv  holdout/…            (document 7)
  twm2/                                   (stage code, one module per stage)
  tests/
  Makefile                                (make build, make verify)
  legacy/                                 (v1 pipeline, until v2 passes its gates)
```

`make verify` runs every gate against the **published bundle**, not the working directory, and any failure stops the publish.

## 10. Milestones

| Milestone | Delivers | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Docs and gates | These documents; golden set and holdout files; `make verify` written as failing tests | 1 week |
| M1 Backbone | Snapshot manifest; Wikidata filter to Parquet; registry; `asset` table; WHS/WDPA/Ramsar ingested | 1 week |
| M2 Places | Candidates, resolution, admission, enrichment, names; landmark gate passes | 1–2 weeks |
| M3 Rank and kinds | Notability, tiers; kind rules; hand-labelled audit; bias audit | 1–2 weeks |
| M4 Print | Territories, regions, print selection, overrides, proof | 1–2 weeks |
| M5 Atlas | Web atlas on the bundle; migration of visits through the crosswalk | per document 5 |

The first prototype runs on **five countries — Egypt, Peru, Italy, Jordan, Tanzania** — and must pass the golden set for them before any other country is built. The world build follows only when the prototype passes.
